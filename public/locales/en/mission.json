    "text": "Founded by accomplished business leaders Olena Malynska, Tatiana Furtseva, and Nina Dombrowska, Women on Boards Ukraine was established in response to the challenging circumstances caused by the aggressive invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The founders personally experienced the challenges faced by professional women who were displaced and whose lives and careers were significantly affected. Inspired by the influential professional women communities they encountered outside of Ukraine, they recognized the importance of a strong and supportive network to uplift and empower women. With a firm belief in the critical role of good corporate governance in rebuilding Ukraine and driving its future economic progress, Women on Boards Ukraine was created as a pillar for a better future, where professional women will play a vital role in Building Better Ukraine."
