          "Ukraine puts the bar high in terms of fighting for its freedom, dignity and values. Fair representation of women on boards is also about freedom, dignity and values. The time has come to make most of the accepted approach to increase the quality of decisions and magnify their positive impact."

          "I am very pleased to join WoB Ukraine to support women’s participations in the boards in Ukraine. Research – including IFC’s – continues to demonstrate that gender diversity in the boardroom boosts financial performance, promotes better decision-making processes and improved environment, social and governance (ESG) practices. Women business leaders have an important role to play in the resilience and growth of Ukraine’s businesses."

          "Lisa Kaestner was appointed as IFC’s Regional Manager for Ukraine and Moldova in July 2022. In this capacity, she is responsible for IFC’s work to mobilize investment and support the private sector in the two countries while overseeing IFC’s response in Ukraine to Russia’s invasion. Ms. Kaestner has taken on this new role at a time when the region is deeply affected by the war and economic uncertainty. Despite the challenges, the private sector can play a significant role in the recovery of the region and its economic transformation.",
          "A US national, Kaestner joined IFC in 1999 as the resident representative in Georgia.  Since then, she has fulfilled a variety of roles in both IFC and World Bank mostly in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.  In 2018-2022, Ms. Kaestner turned her attention to Africa, where she led IFC's advisory services to governments in Eastern and Southern Africa, supporting reforms and policy implementation for private sector-led growth across a range of sectors—including agribusiness, tourism, and housing to ICT and the financial sector. Most recently, she briefly served as the County Manager for Sri Lanka and Maldives until being asked to take up the role in Ukraine and Moldova, due to the unprecedented circumstances. Before IFC, she worked with several nonprofit development organizations in the South Caucasus region. Lisa holds a Master’s degree in Public Policy and Economics from Princeton University."

          " The significance of women's roles within the Ukrainian business landscape is on a pronounced rise. While it is important to acknowledge that war and a complicated procedure for men to leave the country play a role, they are by no means the sole reasons behind this shift. Presently, more and more women are taking the stage at global events, actively engaging in discussions, negotiations, and more.",
          "Yet, the real task at hand is to seize this momentum and consistently bolster this trend. This is a responsible moment to elevate women, not only to grow, but also achieve remarkable success. In light of this, the Women on Boards Ukraine initiative stands out as a great initiative that could help women ascend as leaders. That is why I have decided to support and join the Women on Boards Ukraine initiative, recognizing it as a significant enrichment of the business landscape."
